# Chat Messenger with AI
A CRUD application is a software program that provides basic functionality. It is often used in database management systems, content management systems, and web applications.
The subject of this prompt is a unique CRUD application that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into group and private chats. With this application, users can add AI to group chats, allowing the AI to participate in the conversation and provide helpful insights or responses. Additionally, users can also engage in private chats with the AI to get personalized assistance with various tasks or inquiries.
This AI-powered chat feature has a range of potential applications, such as customer service, education, and personal productivity. For instance, businesses can use the AI to provide automated customer service to their clients, while students can use it to get quick answers to their academic questions. On the other hand, individuals can leverage the AI for personal productivity, such as organizing their schedules or managing their to-do lists.
Overall, this CRUD application presents an exciting opportunity for users to leverage the power of AI in their daily conversations, making them more efficient, productive, and enjoyable.
